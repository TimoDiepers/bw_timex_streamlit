# Getting Started

This section will help you quickly getting started with your time-explicit LCA project. We're keeping it simple here - no deep dives into how things work in the background, no exploring of all the features and options bw_timex has. Just a quick walkthrough of the different steps of a `TimexLCA`. Here's a rundown:

In the following sections, we'll take a look at the steps 1-4. If you want to get more details on how things work, check out our [Theory Section](../theory.md).
